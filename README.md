# Bam Bam Bam
Teach toddlers human-computer interaction.

Or: let them safely play with your computer.

This is an almost-rewrite fork of the earlier "Bam Bam" game, which contained different graphics and sounds (with unclear licensing). This game contains only public domain graphics and sounds.

Someone should really write installation instructions, including how to install a working Pygame package (the only requirement).
Recommendation: use Python2, where Pygame is a lot easier to install. The code runs on Python2 and Python3.

Beta-testers, co-developers, idea-givers and creators of content (images&sounds) are very welcome.

May be important to know: typing "quit" closes the program.
